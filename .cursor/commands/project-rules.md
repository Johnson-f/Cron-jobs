Generate comprehensive project rules for this Leptos/Rust full-stack web application project. Analyze the Cargo.toml and codebase structure to understand:

1. The technology stack (Leptos framework, Actix-web, WASM)
2. Project features (CSR, SSR, hydration modes)
3. Build configuration and optimization settings
4. Dependencies and their purposes

Then create detailed project rules covering:
- Code style and formatting conventions
- Rust and component organization patterns
- Feature flag usage guidelines
- Build and deployment practices
- Common patterns and anti-patterns for this stack
- File structure and naming conventions
- Testing strategies
- Performance considerations for WASM and SSR

Output the rules in a clear, well-organized format suitable for an AI assistant to follow.
